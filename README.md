# Hello-World
First Repository

Hello anonymous strangers on the web. I'm practicing this basic Git exercise to begin my forray into coding. Who knows where this journey will lead? I look at it as a specific time capsule that I can reflect on at a later date, reminiscing about how basic code would round-kick my ass to the floor. I'll probably wince and cringe at the thought of it all, and it'll be great. Thanks for checking out my first exercise and have a great day!
